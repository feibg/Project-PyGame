# Project-PyGame

## WARNING
As of now this project will **only work on windows**, because im importing "pygetwindow" which does **NOT support Linux or MacOS!**

## Why This Exists
This is a project i have been thinking of doing for a long time since i usually copied entire python made games from youtube by hand to learn pygame. As of now i do not have a clear objective for the game so I'm sure it will evolve much more.

## Description
This project is **STILL BEING MADE** so expect a lot of bugs and missing features.
